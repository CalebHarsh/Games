Games that can be played on web

### Overview 

Here are two games that show the use of basic interaction of javascript and html pages. These applications use jQuery to connect to html elements.

### The Games

##### The Crystal Game

* This game is a simple html manipulation of assigning values to elements on the screen. 

* After assigning values to the elements the user then can use the values to try to match a randomly generated number.

* If the user can use the values to match the random number, they win and if they go over the number they lose.

#### Role Playing Game

* This game is a little more advance than the _Crystal Game_.

* The user picks a character and then has to battle all the other ones. It's a game of strategy because attack the wrong character you could lose.

* Fight the characters in the right order though and you win.
